/**
 * The channel between an app document and the page embedding it.
 *
 * An app renders in an iframe on a ledger origin; everything the two say to each
 * other goes through `postMessage`. This module owns delivery, the target origin,
 * and which sender is answered. Message shapes belong to their senders.
 *
 * Both sides are frozen relative to each other, in opposite directions: a bundle
 * carries the runtime bytes vendored when it was written and never replaces them,
 * while the host deploys continuously. So neither may infer what the other
 * understands, and each announces it — the app in `corvic:ready`, the host in
 * `corvic:host`. An unknown type is ignored on both sides.
 *
 * Vocabulary from the app: `corvic:ready`, `corvic:navigate`, `corvic:error`,
 * `corvic:selection`, `corvic:cancelled`, `corvic:renew-credential`, and
 * `corvic:open-external`. From the host: `corvic:host`, `corvic:credential`, and
 * `corvic:inspect`. The host half is implemented by the embedding application,
 * which is deployed separately from any bundle it renders.
 *
 * The served document, not this runtime, also sends `corvic:sign-in-required` when
 * the edge refuses a request for that reason, so a bundle written before it still
 * tells its host.
