/**
 * Fetching that outlives a dependency restarting underneath it.
 *
 * A live app is the last hop of a chain that already retries: the control plane
 * retries an `UNAVAILABLE` gRPC call five times before the per-ledger edge turns
 * it into a 503. The edge's meaning is "this exact request can succeed shortly".
 * An iframe has no navigation-level retry and the reader has no address bar; a
 * single attempt here is the app's final answer.
 *
 * Retryable statuses are those whose meaning is "later". A refusal for want of a
 * credential means "not as you are", so {@link fetchRetrying} answers it by
 * getting a credential and asking once more — see `credential.ts`.
